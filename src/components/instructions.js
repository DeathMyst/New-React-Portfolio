    <h1>Instructions to Play</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>The name of the game is BlackJack or 21.</li>
        <li>The object of the game is to get a BlackJack, which is an ace (A) and a face card (K, Q, J) or a 10, to
            equal 21 or to get as close to 21 as you can WITHOUT going over 21.</li>
        <li>The Ace (A) card counts as either 1 or as 11. So if your delt an Ace (A) and say a 5, that totals either 6
            or 16.</li>
        <li>If the Dealer is delt an Ace (A) face up, you can take insurance on your bet, which is one half your bet. If
            the dealer does have 21 or blackjack, you keep your bet and the insurance you posted, if the dealer does not
            have blackjack then you lose just the insurance you posted and keep your bet to finish playing the hand out.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <li>Click Deal to deal your hand.</li>
        <li>Once you have your hand decide if you want to HIT (take another card) or STAND (just play the cards you
            have.</li>
        <li>Total your cards and HIT until your happy with what you have OR until you Bust (go over 21)</li>
        <li>If you get a BlackJack, and Ace and a 10 value card (K, Q, J, 10) and the dealer does not get a BlackJack,
            you will be paid immediately and the hand is over.</li>
